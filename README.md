## Filing Experiments

We use GitHub Issues to track and propose new experiments. Create an issue using the "Experiment Proposal" template to suggest new experiments to explore.

This helps us organize research efforts and track what we've tried.

## Purpose

These experiments explore various implementations and configurations for agentic systems as part of the ASP initiative.
