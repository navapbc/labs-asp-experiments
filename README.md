# Labs ASP Experiments

This repository contains experiments involved with setting up experiments for the **Agentic Submission Project (ASP)**.

## Current Projects

- `mastra-test-app/` - Testing environment for Mastra workflows and agents

## Experiment Categories

Our ASP experiments fall into several categories:

- **Multi-Agent Systems** - Coordination and communication between multiple agents
- **Web Automation** - Browser-based automation and data extraction
- **Workflow Orchestration** - Complex multi-step agentic workflows  
- **Tool Integration** - Integration with external APIs and services
- **Performance Testing** - Load testing and optimization of agent systems

## Contributing New Experiments

To propose a new experiment:

1. **Create an Issue**: Use the "Experiment Proposal" template
2. **Choose Complexity**: Simple (1-2 days), Medium (1 week), or Complex (2+ weeks)
3. **Define Success Criteria**: Clear metrics for measuring experiment outcomes
4. **Specify Requirements**: Dependencies, APIs, setup needs, etc.

## Project Structure

New experiments can be added as:
- **New directories** in this repository
- **New features** in existing projects  
- **Standalone repositories** (linked here)

## Purpose

These experiments explore various implementations and configurations for agentic systems as part of the ASP initiative.
